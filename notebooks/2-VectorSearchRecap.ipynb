    "### InterSystems IRIS Vector Search: An Overview\n",
    "InterSystems IRIS Vector Search brings powerful AI and machine learning capabilities directly into your SQL workflows by enabling the storage and querying of high-dimensional vector embeddings within a relational database. Vector search works by comparing embedding vectors—numerical representations of unstructured data like text—to determine semantic similarity, making it ideal for tasks like intelligent search and information retrieval. With InterSystems IRIS, you can store these embeddings using the optimized VECTOR and EMBEDDING data types. The EMBEDDING type streamlines the process by converting text into vectors directly through SQL, without requiring direct interaction with an embedding model. By integrating these capabilities into standard SQL operations, IRIS transforms your relational database into a high-performance hybrid vector database—ready to support next-generation AI applications.\n",

The data set includes ~1,500 patient encounters, each with structured and coded medical data.

This might include things such as their commuting situation, their mood during the encounter, or other information not easily categorized into a structured encounter record.\n",
