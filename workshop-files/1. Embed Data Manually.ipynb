He described the hitting of the frontal aspect of his leg. A physical examination revealed swelling and tenderness on the patella, the lateral aspect of the distal femur, and the medial aspect of the proximal tibia. Because of the pain, the knee could not be examined properly. The range of motion was severely limited by the pain, but a neurovascular examination was normal. Standard radiographs showed prepatellar intra-articular effusion and an isolated avulsion fracture with the elevation of the tibial attachment of the PCL (\\n).

The tibial fragment measured 11 × 4 mm and presented a maximal displacement of 7 mm. No other ligamentous, meniscal, or chondral injuries were observed in a magnetic resonance imaging examination (\\n). Because of minimal displacement, we decided to treat the avulsion fracture in a conservative way. The knee was immobilized for 6 weeks, with a long leg cast with 30 degrees of knee flexion. The patient was asked to walk with crutches, avoiding weight bearing. After removing the cast, the patient was allowed to begin gentle range-of-motion activities and weight bearing. The patient was asked to report for regular clinical and radiological controls every 4 to 6 weeks until 3 months after the trauma. No pain or instability was detected during a physical examination, and magnetic resonance imaging showed progressive consolidation of the fracture over time.
