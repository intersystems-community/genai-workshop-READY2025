    "\n",
    "In the previous sections, we explored how to load data, create vector embeddings, and use helper libraries like Langchain to build the foundational components of a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system. We successfully set up a retriever capable of fetching relevant documents from our InterSystems IRIS database.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, building a RAG system is an iterative process. How do we know if our retriever is fetching the *most* relevant documents? How do we measure the quality of the answers generated by our system? This is where evaluation comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will introduce the concept of a **test-first framework** for RAG systems. This approach emphasizes creating evaluation mechanisms *before* or *alongside* development, allowing us to continuously measure and improve our system's performance. We will leverage **Ragas**, a powerful open-source library specifically designed for evaluating RAG pipelines."

    "This iterative process of `Evaluate -> Hypothesize -> Change -> Re-evaluate` is central to systematically improving your RAG system. In the upcoming notebooks (like Notebook 4: Connecting Chat to Vectors and beyond), we will be making changes to our RAG pipeline. This evaluation framework will be invaluable for measuring the impact of those changes."

    "In this notebook, we've laid the groundwork for a test-first approach to RAG development by:\n",
    "- Understanding the critical role of evaluation.\n",
    "- Introducing Ragas as a powerful tool for RAG assessment.\n",
    "- Generating a synthetic test dataset.\n",
    "- Implementing key Ragas metrics to evaluate our retriever (from IRISVector) and a generator.\n",
    "\n",
    "This framework provides us with a quantitative way to measure the performance of our RAG system. As we proceed to build more sophisticated chat applications and tune our retrieval and generation strategies in subsequent notebooks, we can continuously refer back to these evaluation techniques to guide our development and ensure we are making tangible improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next:** In Notebook 4, \"Connecting Chat to Vectors,\" we will focus on building a more interactive chat application. The evaluation methods learned here will be crucial for assessing how well that chat application performs in terms of retrieval accuracy and response quality."
