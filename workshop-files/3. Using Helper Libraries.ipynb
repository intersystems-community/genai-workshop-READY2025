It did not show any focus of surface ulceration, but bleeding spots were distributed randomly. The upper posterior teeth were displaced and attached to the mass on the palatal side. On palpation, the growth was firm and tender with an irregular surface and was fixed to the upper left alveolus. A computed tomography angiogram was taken to check the vascularity of the lesion which revealed no irregular feeder vessels. Further imaging showed a soft-tissue shadow with calcifications. The soft-tissue shadow measured approximately 10 cm × 6 cm in size not involving the mandible but causing destruction of maxilla in the premolar region. Routine blood investigations and serology tests were done. Since it was an abnormally extensive lesion, we approached by giving Weber F\n",
