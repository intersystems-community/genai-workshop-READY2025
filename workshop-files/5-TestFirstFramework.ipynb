    "## 5. Creating a Test-First Framework for RAG Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we'll implement a comprehensive evaluation framework using DeepEval, a modern evaluation library specifically designed for LLM applications and RAG systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why DeepEval for RAG Evaluation?\n",
    "\n",
    "DeepEval provides several advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **RAG-Specific Metrics:** Built-in metrics for answer relevancy, faithfulness, and contextual recall\n",
    "2. **Synthetic Data Generation:** Automatically generate test cases from your knowledge base\n",
    "3. **LLM-as-a-Judge:** Uses advanced LLMs to evaluate responses intelligently\n",
    "4. **Easy Integration:** Simple API that works well with existing RAG pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "While this evaluation is not tightly integrated with the app you built in Sections 1-4, it evaluates a retrieval mechanism from the same data set and could be repurposed later in your own use cases for experimentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the module below to import the required libraries, create the InterSystems IRIS connection, and initialize the data retrieval mechanism."

This is a reflection of the lightweight demo environment we are using -- with such a limited data set in this sample exercise (we have only 100 case reports stored), and a lightweight OpenAI model being used. This is unlikely to be enough to answer generalized questions about patient conditions. Using evaluation tools like this can help to highlight pieces of your application that need attention.\n",
